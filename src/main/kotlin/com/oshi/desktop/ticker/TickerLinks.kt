 * 📈 Turn `@AAPL` in a message into a TradingView chart link.
 *
 * Port of `OSHI/TickerLinks.swift` (via Android `util/TickerLinks.kt`, copied verbatim —
 * `__TICKER_QUOTES_2026_09_23__`), character for character where it matters:
 * the two regular expressions, the alias tables and the URL are the SAME, so a
 * message rendered on an iPhone and on Android links to the same chart.
 *
 * **THE SIGIL IS THE WHOLE DESIGN** (`TickerLinks.swift:4-11`). Detecting bare
 * uppercase words as tickers is unusable in a messenger: "OK", "ASAP", "USA",
 * "AI", "PDF", "TV", "OSHI" itself — ordinary conversation is full of them, and
 * every false positive turns a word someone typed into a link to a stock chart.
 * Requiring `@` means the sender opts in, once, per ticker.
 *
 * Everything here is pure text → ranges. No network, no state, so it is safe to
 * run on every message as it renders.

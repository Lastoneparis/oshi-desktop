/**
 * 🪙 `/pay <token> [public]` — put a Cashu token in this conversation.
 *
 * Pure text → decision, like [TickerLinks] and `CheckInPermissionPolicy`: no
 * Android, no network, no state, so every rule below is covered by a JVM test
 * rather than only being reachable by typing into a running app.
 *
 * Two refusals carry the whole feature, and both are copied from how this
 * command behaves elsewhere in the space rather than invented here:
 *
 *  1. **Nothing that does not decode goes on the wire.** A typo in a pasted
 *     token is money thrown away — the sender believes they paid, the
 *     recipient sees a string that no wallet will take, and neither of them
 *     learns why. So the token is decoded, strictly, before anything is sent.
 *  2. **A bearer token into a group needs the word `public`.** Everyone who can
 *     read the thread can spend it, and the first to redeem wins. Typing
 *     `/pay <token>` in a group therefore does not send: it explains, and asks
 *     for `/pay <token> public`. One extra word is a cheap price for not
 *     giving a stranger your money by reflex.

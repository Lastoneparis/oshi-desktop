/**
 * __CALL_RATING_2026_09_22__
 *
 * Whether to ask this person about this call.
 *
 * Pure and separate from [CallRatingManager] — the same reasoning as
 * [CallSummaryFormat] — so every gate can be tested without a device, a clock or
 * a SharedPreferences. The manager reads the stored state, calls [decide], and
 * writes back whatever the decision says changed.
 *
 * The rules, in the order they are applied:
 *
 *  1. **Too short.** Under [MIN_SECONDS] there was no conversation to judge.
 *  2. **Weekly ceiling.** At most [MAX_ASKS_PER_WEEK] asks in any rolling week,
 *     whatever else is true. This outranks every reason to ask.
 *  3. **Cooldown.** A quiet period after the previous ask, shorter when the call
 *     ended badly ([COOLDOWN_ABNORMAL_MS]) than when it ended normally
 *     ([COOLDOWN_MS]).
 *  4. **Abnormal end always asks.** A call that dropped, errored or lost the peer
 *     is exactly the one worth hearing about, so it skips the sampling below.
 *  5. **Sampling.** Otherwise only every [SAMPLE_EVERY_NTH_GOOD_CALL]-th good
 *     call is asked about. Being asked after every call is the fastest way to
 *     train someone to dismiss the sheet unread.
